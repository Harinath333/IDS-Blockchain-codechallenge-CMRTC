# Fungible Token Challenge

This repository contains a simple implementation of a fungible token created using Solidity and deployed on a local Ethereum network. The token supports basic functionality, such as transferring tokens between addresses. The project is designed to demonstrate the process of creating, compiling, deploying, and interacting with a smart contract.

## Usage

This project demonstrates how to create and deploy a simple fungible token using Solidity and interact with it using Python and Web3.py. The token is deployed on a local Ethereum network (such as Ganache or any Ethereum testnet) and supports basic functionality, like transferring tokens between addresses.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interacting with Ethereum
- [py-solc-x](https://github.com/ethereum/py-solc-x) to compile Solidity contracts
- An Ethereum node running locally or a testnet (e.g., Ganache or Rinkeby)
